# Number Generator

#### JavaScript/JQuery Exercise for Epicodus, 01/19/2018

#### By **Tyler Kostelak**

## Description

This is currently an unfinished application. So far, it asks the user to input a number, and if the number is divisible by three, it displays "I'm afraid I can't do that Dave." If the user inputs a number that contains a one, it displays the text "Beep!" There are more behaviors that I intend to give the application, including:

  - If the user inputs a number that contains a zero, it will display "boop!"
  - For any other number the user inputs, it will display a range of numbers that starts at zero and counts up to the number the user inputs.

  Keep in mind, the actions of the page are prioritized by importance to avoid conflicting logic.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
